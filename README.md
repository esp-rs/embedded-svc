# Rust APIs and abstractions for embedded services

![CI](https://github.com/esp-rs/embedded-svc/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-svc/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-svc)

This crate ships traits for embedded features such as wifi, networking, httpd, logging.
The intended use is for concrete implementations to use the traits provided in this crate as a common base.
This would eventually lead to a portable embedded ecosystem. The APIs currently have a single implementation for the [ESP32[-XX] / ESP-IDF](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-svc).
However, they are meant to be portable and should be possible to implement for other boards too.
